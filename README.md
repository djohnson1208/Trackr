# Trackr
A task-tracking web app that tracks and logs simple tasks in a database and displays them to you via an Angular-based web page

Created as a programming assessment, this application uses .NetCore and Entity Framework as its back-end components to communicate with a Sql Server Database.
To run the app first configure the database using the sql scripts provided in the database project and set the connection string in appsettings.json.
Afterwards navigate to the project folder in a command prompt and run "dotnet Web.dll" to start the application.
